# SticksConsole

The game of sticks is generally played between two players who start with one finger extended on each hand. 
Players take turns attacking another players hand using one of their hands and the player that was attacked
adds the amount of the attacking players hand to their hand and that is their new total. Once a player reaches
five fingers on their hand, they subtract 5 fingers or go modulus 5. The opposing player wins when the both of
their opponent's hands have 0 fingers extended on them.

The version I have implemented here allows 2 to 4 players to play on the console.
